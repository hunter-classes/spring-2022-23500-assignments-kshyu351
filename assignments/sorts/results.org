I learned that choosing a pivot for quick sort algorithms does indeed, matter. "Good" pivots are
pivots are avoided as the first or last element of the list. Always choosing the start and end of a list
results in a potential for worst-case performance. Additionally, the pivot chosen impacts how fast the 
quick sort runs. A better pivot, like the median or mean of the list is more preferred because it is partitions
the list into two more equal parts, rather than having uneven left and right sides. Consequently, a better pivot
leads to more efficient functions that take less memory and time to run. In choosing the pivot as the mean or median, 
the partitioning is more effective as well as proficient. Despite both pivots succesfully sorting the list, the quickest sort
would be more ideal.
