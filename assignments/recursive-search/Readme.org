Dear Mr. Zamansky, 


My program runs into a segmentation dump but runs fine on Mac and I tried
my best trying to figure out what was different/what to change but failed to 
find the error. 

I understand that my program should be able to run on Linux,
however, it is another level of difficulty being able to decipher the differences 
in C++ versions between Linux and Mac, especially as a student who is a beginner in C++. 
Unfortunately, I do not have a Linux machine nor can I carry around one that easily, and I 
primarily use my Mac for all things school related. 

I hope you understand where I am coming from and keep this in mind when grading this and future assignments. 

Thank you for your time and understanding,
Kirsten
